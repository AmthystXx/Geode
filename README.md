# geode
A Minecraft datapack library focused on adding tools for datapackers to make it easier to add fully custom content to the game.

This datapack will replace BlockCore, which is now deprecated. Please update your packs to use the Geode format. A legacy version of BlockCore will be embedded in Geode, but support is not guaranteed, and it only exists for compatability with datapacks based on BlockCore. It will not be updated.
